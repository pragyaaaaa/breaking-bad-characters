# breaking-bad-characters
This is fun quick project which was made for purspose of how we can use a 3rd party API to get data and display it using desired layout.
It uses axios as HTTP client.
CSS, HTML for styling (obvious, but still!).

And that's all. Just a lazy sunday project for revising how top fetch data from an API.
